# Make-your-choice-in-C
This is a C programming base Project   . #Project Name: Make your Choice in C This is my C language base project. Where user will have 30 choices!!! Yes user can pick any choice and do that particular work. Easy and Simple project. To make this possible I did #625 line code. And now it’s running successfully.  That’s mean you can run your 30 choices by using 1 program. The 30 choices are  1.Addition 2. Subtraction 3. Multiplication 4.Division 5.Root 6.Factorial 7.Squre 8.Cube 9.Odd or even 10.Largest of given three number 11.Smallest of given three number 12.Fibonacci series 13.Reverse a Number 14.Reverse a String 15.Number in Ascending Order 16.Number in Descending Order 17.Checking Number is positive or Negative 18.Checking Vowel or not 19.Finding Leap Year 20.Finding Area of a tringle 21.Finding area of a circle  22.Finding area of a Trapizum 23.Finding Area of a squre 24.Finding Area of a Rectangle 25.Printing N numbers 26.Convert lowerCase to UpperCase 27.Convert UpperCase to LowerCase 28.Calculate Distance for travelling  29.number to check Palindrome 30.Number swapping I usually worked http://www.onlinegdb.com for making projects. So I did it here also. If you want you can check the project promo - https://youtu.be/e5BYQ4-XQhs (in my YouTube channel . Because I cant share the main file of this project . ) The project is accepted by the faculty of daffodil International University and they said in the review  That “well done tasnuva tabassum Oshin “ It’s been a wonderful experience for me.  


#Project Name: #C_Programming_Basic_Challenge
I make this project in C programming language. 
This is a project where anyone can test his/her C programming Basic Skills. To complete this project I need to code #2142 lines. And now it’s running successfully. 
I already showed it to some of my university faculty members. They like this project very much. They are happy with my performance. (Note. it is not for marks/sub base project)  
Thanks to them because without their support I may not able to complete this project.
This project I never gona forget this experience daily 4-7hr continuous coding life), fixing bug omg!! Can’t explain! Thank you Allah to give me so much patience. 
Project Summary: 
As it is a skill judgment type software so,
Mainly there is a 3 level, 1-easy, 2-medium, 3-hard 
You can pick your level and then atomically question will appeared. (It’s like multiple choice type question) 
You just need to give the correct answer (input-1/2/3/4)
If your answer is correct you will get some points and automatically go the next question.
If your answer is not correct then your test is over.  

You can start your test now: for this go to this google drive and download the file .exe and just run it.

Note: I can’t share source code!
Future Plan: I will add other language questions on this . 
Pray for me.
